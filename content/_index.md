## Experience

### Software Engineer(Backend) | KitaLulus
*2023 Oct – Present*

* **Designed and implemented** scalable backend systems using various stacks (e.g. Golang, NestJS, SpringBoot, etc.), optimizing performance and reliability. 
* **Developed** robust data **migration** scripts to transform and transfer legacy datasets to new schemas, ensuring 100% data integrity and consistency during service transitions. 
* **Engineered** context-specific **optimizations** for **high-traffic features**, implementing strategies such as Redis caching, memory footprint reduction, and database indexing to resolve latency bottlenecks. 
* **Diagnosed** and **resolved complex production** issues within a distributed event-driven architecture (spanning gRPC, REST, Pub/Sub, PostgreSQL, and Elasticsearch), significantly reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR). 
* **Authored and presented** technical RFCs for new system features, leading design reviews to ensure architectural scalability before moving to implementation. 
* Adapted team processes from bi-weekly Sprints to a **Kanban** model, improving task prioritization and visibility of high-priority production fixes. 
* **Collaborated cross-functionally** with Product Managers, Mobile/Web Frontend, QA, and Data teams to align on technical requirements, resulting in seamless feature rollouts and reduced integration bugs. 
* **Designed and implemented** a tool for **monitoring system** performance, reducing debugging time 55%. 
* **Delivered GraphQL** APIs for dynamic querying in multiple micro-services, improving data accessibility and frontend flexibility. 
* Converted to a full-time position after a successful 3-month internship. 
* Recognized as **Employee of the Month** (September 2024) for demonstrating exceptional ownership during the high-pressure consolidation of subscription packages, implementing a transitional quota system to ensure a seamless experience for paid users.
